### Some things about me: I really enjoy music, I listen to just about any genre of music. If it sounds good I listen to it. I also enjoy occasionally writing although I prefer to read books instead of trying to write them. I also enjoy gaming even though I'm not a hardcore gamer by any means, I just occasionally game. Some of my favorite games include; Red Dead Redemption 2, GTA5, Far Cry Primal. There's a lot of video games I want to get but haven't gotten yet.
1. First goal for this course: To enhance my coding skills since I only know the very basics.
2. Second goal for this course: To get a career in coding.
3. Third goal for this course: I know this falls under coding skills, but I want to get better at JavaScript because I suck at it.
